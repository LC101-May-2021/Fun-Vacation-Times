          <p>Each year millions of tourists from all over the globe flock to Riviera Maya to vacation. With it's sandy
              beaches, clear water, and inviting atmosphere Riviera Maya is host to several all-inclusive resorts. I will now present
               reviews on the three resorts which I have frequented. </p>

          <h2><li>Valentin Imperial Riviera Maya</li></h2>
          <p>First up is Valentin Imperial Riveira Maya where I visited in June of 2017 on a
              couples trip. This resort has two humongous swimmimg pools separated by a waterfall 
              and they are referred to as 'The Main Pool' and then there is a smaller pool located behind a 
              block of rooms known as 'The Quiet Pool'. The great thing about the quiet pool is there was
              waiter service!<br>The resort kept it's temporary residents entertained with a schedule of (optional)
             events. During my stay I went to The Michael Jackson (impersonator, in case anyone was wondering) 
             show, danced the night away every evening with The Imperial Band, and attended the Foam party which
             is a staple at almost all of the resorts in the area. </p>

           <h2><li>Ocean Maya Royale</li></h2>
           <p>I visited Ocean Maya Royale in October of 2018 with my little sister on a bonding trip. This 
              resort is a good choice on the budget. It had a smaller pool but it was still equipped with a 
              swim-up bar and had the almost obligatory foam party. This resort did not have much by the way of 
              scheduled entertainment but it did have a bar that was open 24 hours in the lobby area. <br>
              It was at this resort that I met the most people from all over the world. It was amazing to me 
              to hear all of the different languages. I wish I could understand them all! </p>

                <h2><li>Excellence Riviera Cancun</li></h2>
                <p> Needing to take a breather from reality for a moment, I chose Excellence Riviera Maya as
                   the resort for my first international solo adventure in October of 2019. This resort is regularly
                   tauted as being quiet and lowkey and it was exactly that. There was no foam party here (to show 
                   you they mean business) but I did enjoy a rousing game of Bingo at the pool. The evening 
                   entertainment was more so live shows that you would gather and watch at the outside theater
                  than interactive although there was one night with a <b>silent party</b>. 
                  <aside>A silent party (also known as a 'silent disco') is one where the attendees
                        wear headphones which can tune into 3 different frequencies. Each frequency is color coded
                        so other guests (and the DJ's if it's a live event) can see who is listening to what. Those 
                        without headphones do not hear anything and it gives the impression that people are dancing 
                        to no music! This type of party is great for song variety for the participant and also to avoid
                        noise violations.  
                  </aside> <br>
                   Since I was in the mood to pamper myself I went all out with a swim-up room complete with 
                   drink service right to your patio! There was also a jetted hot tub on the patio which I put to good
                   use. You may think that a hot tub and Riviera Maya weather do not mix, but you would be incorrect.  </p>
                   <h3>Excursions off the resort that I participated in:</h3>
                      <P>&#8226;Since I was solo and specifically on vacation to relax, I did not venture off
                         for any excursions. I did take a bike tour off the resort with staff and other guests. </p>
                     <h3>Most Lasting Impression:</h3>
                      &#8226;Outdoor hot tub naps rock!
